# Interview Scheduler
## Intro
Welcome to my scheduler app for LHL appointments. This webapp was developed with learning react as the main priority and provides an easy to use UI to book/cancel/edit appointments for interviews. Clicking an empty slot allows the user to add a new interview, with a name input as well as a list of interviewers to choose from; (The name input is required and if no interviewer is chosen it will display it as such). Deleting and editing buttons are available on each interview and each day's spots are dynamically updated with each booking or deletion. 
This project was a great introduction to React for me and also introduced me to new testing frameworks such as Storybook, Jest and Cypress.
